session: 1/10/2024

to do:
find a site in distress: bridge, rooftop, hallway, family house, etc
distress means many things --> underuse, bad location, ...
--------------------
before you go:
	 --> cellular and location is turned on on gsm
got here and try to map your entire route.
	--> lots of images of misuse, leak, anoying stopligh.  30 + images. negative or positive.
-------------------

photogrammetry video:
	--> 1 minute video on cellphone
	--> tips: smooth video, no sudden zoom ins or movements
		no reflecive surfaces like glass, etc
		a lot of overlap, dont zoom in to much
		walk around, dont stand still and rotate, this will not work
		most tutorials cover images, but dont bother, film is also fine
		a (very tragic) example of a good photogrammetry video would be something like this
